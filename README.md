##Course Project 1

See [the instructions](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1) for details on where to download the data and what the instructor asked us to do with it. The data was compressed in a zip file at the source. It was downloaded and uncompressed into a .txt file. From this file, each of my scripts will extract the necessary data and produce plots per the instructions.
